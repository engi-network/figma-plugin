# Same Story React Figma Plugin

## Quickstart

- Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn build:watch` to start webpack in watch mode.
- Open `Figma` -> `Plugins` -> `Development` -> `Import plugin from manifest...` and choose `manifest.json` file from this repo.

## Hot Reloading (macOS only)

Not the smoothest experience, but way better than needing to press a hotkey. In case you use the Figma Beta change App name in `applescript.sh`.

```sh
  $ brew install modd
  $ yarn modd
```
